vCloud Availability is a supplemental product for vCloud Director that allows hypervisor Replication of workloads and failover from vSphere on-premises and between vCloud Director installations. I have been working with the product team at VMware for over a year and they have done a really good job of integrating feedback from all Service Providers and really working to make the product better. Another positive announcement from VMware this week that vCloud Availability will soon be added to the vExpert program:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/vExperts?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#vExperts</a> - guess what was added to the License Portal today?

For a little of a year now (since vCloud Availability Cloud-to-Cloud v1.5) I have been very slowly developing a "unofficial" PowerShell module for vCloud Availability. The motivation really was initially to and to enable me to automate compliance and monitoring and to facilitate repeatable deployments. Over time its grown into a bit of a beast and now I think its ready for some general consumption. (Be warned ! It still needs work)

I hope that others in the vExpert & VCPP community can use the module to make life a little easier and contributions and feedback are welcome. My focus going forward will be enhancement of the "Replication Management" functions and add more support for vCenter based functions as time permits.

## Installation
Install VMware.vCAV.Community module from the PowerShell Gallery:
```
Install-Module -Name VMware.vCAV.Community -Scope CurrentUser
Import-Module VMware.vCAV.Community
```
Connect to the vCloud Availability Service using a supported authentication method
```
Connect-vCAVService -Server "vcav.pigeonnnuggets.com" -AuthProvider vCDLogin
```

The project is hosted on GitHub here: https://github.com/AdrianBegg/VMware.vCAV.Community

## Documentation
All of the cmdlets in the module should have well described PowerShell help available. For a list of cmdlets available use the `Get-Command *vCAV*` command after the module has been imported or installed. For detailed help including examples please use `Get-help <cmdlet> -Detailed` (e.g. `Get-help Get-vCAVReplications -Detailed`). If you have any questions about usage please don't hesitate to contact me on Twitter or the VCPP/vExpert/VMWare Code Slack.
